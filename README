Nessembler
----------------------------------------------------
This package currently works on Windows Linux development machines. It may work on Mac, but it is untested.

Prerequisite packages:
Scons
Bison
Flex lexer
MSYS (for Windows)

To build, from the main directory, open a terminal or MinGW shell and type:

scons

To compile the metroid rom, run the following command from any prompt:

./nessembler -i metroid/metroid.asm -o metroid.nes

The source file is "metroid/metroid.asm". The binary "metroid.nes" can be run in any NES emulator.

Windows Notes
----------------------------------------------------
For Windows, you will have to install GnuWin32's flex and bison packages from here:

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html

Copy the "FlexLexer.h" header file into the MinGW include directory and the "libfl.a, liby.a" libraries into
the MinGW lib directory. This fixes the 'CFile' attribute error that you may get in SCons. Then, you will also
have to install flex and bison into MinGW in order for the actual compile to work. From MinGW Shell, type the
following command:

mingw-get install msys-flex msys-bison

This should get it to work. If not, feel free to contact me.
